Research topic: Longitudinal Predictors of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury among Gender Diverse Population: Machine Learning Approaches

Gender diverse individuals (i.e., identifying their gender as different from the sex assigned at birth) demonstrate higher rates of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) compared to other sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Despite the importance of identifying prospective risk factors for NSSI, few studies have examined the longitudinal predictors of NSSI among gender diverse individuals. To address this gap, the current study investigated which factors would prospectively predict past-year non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors among gender diverse individuals.

The present study applied supervised machine model based on 10-fold cross-validation of LASSO regularized logistic regressions. Training goal of the model consisted of discriminatory accuracy of presence/absence of NSSI engagement during the 12-month follow-up period.
